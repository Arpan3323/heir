  This pass adds encrypt and decrypt functions for each compiled function in the
  IR. These functions maintain the same interface as the original function,
  while the compiled function may lose some of this information by the lowerings
  to ciphertext types (e.g., a scalar ciphertext, when lowered through RLWE schemes,
  must be encoded as a tensor).

  This pass occurs at the secret level, which is necessary because some
  backends like the plaintext backend don't actually encrypt, but still require
  the ciphertext layout/packing logic to convert cleartexts to plaintexts.
